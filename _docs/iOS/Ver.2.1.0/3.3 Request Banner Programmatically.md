Please check the section ‘Best Practices’ to understand the proper approach to implement this functionality.

In addition to requesting banner ads via a storyboard, you can also request a banner ad and add it to the view hierarchy *programatically*.  

Building on where you left off from creating a MPS instance and requesting a page object, you can just add the following code to **ViewController.swift**.

```swift
    page.getBannerAd(adUnit: "testbox", rootViewController: self, success: { [weak self] (ad) in
        if let sSelf = self {
            sSelf.view.addSubview(ad)
        }
    }) { (error) in
        print(error.localizedDescription)
    }

```

Or, if you're following along in Objective-C add the following code to **ViewController.m**.

```objc
    __weak ViewController *wself = self;
    NSDictionary *targeting = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys: "targetingValue", "targetingKeys", nil];
    [page getBannerAdWithAdUnit:"testbox" additionalTargeting:targeting rootViewController:self success:^(MPSBannerAdView * _Nonnull adView) {
        [wself.view addSubview:adView];
    } failure:^(NSError * _Nonnull error) {
        NSLog(error);
    }];
    
```

Build and run the application.  
You will see the following result in the simulator. 

## Result
Congratulations, you've successfully made your banner ad request programatically!
