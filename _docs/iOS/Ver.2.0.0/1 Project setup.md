#  CocoaPods


## 1.1 Install Cocoapods

CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects.

CocoaPods is built with Ruby and is installable with the default Ruby available on OS X. We recommend you use the default ruby.
Using the default Ruby install can require you to use sudo when installing gems. 

```ruby 
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

## 1.2 Add MPS SDK as a dependency and Install it

List the dependencies in a text file named Podfile in your Xcode project directory:
```ruby
platform :ios, '8.0'

target 'YOUR_PROJECT_TARGET' do 
    use_frameworks!
    
    pod "nbcu_mps_ios_sdk/google_mobile_ads", :git => 'https://github.com/NBCUOTS/mobile_mps_sdk_ios_examples.git', :tag => 'release-2.0.0'
end
```

Then install all your dependencies.
```ruby
pod install
```
You should have access to "https://github.com/NBCUOTS/mobile_mps_sdk_ios_examples.git" repository.


## 1.3 Update App Transport Security in iOS 9

Google Mobile Ads SDK requires adding the **NSAllowsArbitraryLoads** exception to make sure your ads are not impacted by App Transport Security (ATS) on iOS 9 devices.   
For iOS 10 devices, **NSAllowsArbitraryLoadsForMedia** and **NSAllowsArbitraryLoadsInWebContent** are required to make sure your ads are not impacted by ATS.

Add these values to the **info.plist** file of your application. 

```
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```
Reference: [Google ATS details](https://developers.google.com/mobile-ads-sdk/docs/dfp/ios/app-transport-security). 


## 1.4 Update Simulator Scheme Environment Variables (optional)

If you want to disable system log messages, you can optionally add **OS_ACTIVITY_MODE=disable** to the *Environment Variables* under *Arguments* of the scheme.
